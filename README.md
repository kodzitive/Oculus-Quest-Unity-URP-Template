# Oculus-Quest-Unity-URP-Template
Unity 2020.1 Universal Rendering Pipeline template for Oculus Quest

I got tired of repeatedly having to look up the optimal Player settings to get decent results with Oculus Quest and Universal Rendering Pipeline. I'll update periodically as development continues.

Includes the following:
- Universal Rendering Pipeline and renderer adjusted
- Oculus XR Plugin
- XR Interaction Toolkit
- Optimal player settings (adjust for your company name)
- A plane
- An XR Rig
